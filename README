jqtnt
=====

jqtnt is a demonstration, how to integrate jQuery and jQuery UI into a tntnet
application. It contains the example code from the _jQuery in Tntnet Howto_
document.

The examples are built as a standalone application. You need `cxxtools` and
`tntnet` to build the application. After installing them execute the following
commands to build:

    autoreconf -i
    ./configure
    make

To run the application execute

    ./jqtnt

Now you should have the tntnet web server running on port 8000.
